The power supply can be one of two options:

- MeanWell-IRM-10-5 (datasheet in References folder and [here](https://www.meanwell.com/Upload/PDF/IRM-10/IRM-10-SPEC.PDF))
- TracoPower-TMPS-10105 (datasheet in References folder and [here](https://www.tracopower.com/products/tmps10.pdf))

It also comes with a 1.6A fuse. Check the datasheets for other available input convertions and limits.

The PCB has the footprint to fit inside a [Bopla Ref. 38102200](https://octopart.com/search?q=bopla+38102200) IP65 Enclosure with two built-in cable glands. 

## Solar power controller [optional]

We use DF Robot MPTT Sunfolower Solar power manager 5V V1.0 [from here](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Solar_Power_Manager_5V_SKU__DFR0559). It is fitted inside the enclosure with a small laser cut (or 3D printed if not available) flange.

## Enclosure

A [Bopla Polymas PK 102-211](https://www.bopla.de/en/enclosure-technology/product/euromas-polymas/euromas-polymas-enclosures/pk-102-211.html) enclosure is used. The models can be found in the manufacturer's site in STP format.
